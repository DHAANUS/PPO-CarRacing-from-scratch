# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) — CarRacing-v3 (PyTorch from Scratch)

This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of the **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** algorithm in PyTorch.  
The agent is trained on the **CarRacing-v3** environment from Gymnasium, demonstrating continuous control with stable policy gradient updates.

---

## Key Features
- Fully implemented from scratch in PyTorch  
- **Rollout Buffer** for storing and processing trajectories  
- **Clipped Surrogate Objective** to stabilize policy updates  
- **Entropy Regularization** to encourage exploration  
- Modular design for easy extension and testing  
- Demo MP4 video of trained agent included  

---

## Training Results
The agent successfully learns to drive in the CarRacing-v3 environment.
